    <p>The quality of Scale explores the relationship between the notion of public/intimacy and monument/object especially referring to the quality of sculpture and its relationship with exhibition space, viewer and light.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The quality of intimacy is attached to an object in a fairly direct proportion as its size diminished in relation to oneself. The quality of publicness is attached in proportion as the size increases in relation to oneself&rdquo; ( Robert Morris , Continuous Project Altered Daily, The Writings of Robet Morris, in Note on Sculpture Part 2, p13, October Book, the MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1995)</p>
