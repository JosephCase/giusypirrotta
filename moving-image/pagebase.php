				    The focus of the work is the study of light in and outside the screen, in terms of light shot and emitted between production and postproduction. Light is
				    shown as an abstracted component in its consistence and ephemerality in the ambiguity between what was shot and what is made with other equipment and in
				    postproduction.

				    The film is developed and printed by hand. A spotlight is recreated manually frame by frame as if the main character is running toward it. Moreover, the
				    printer gate was modified in order to recreate a hole which cuts the frame as if a spotlight is enlightening the space.
