</p> 
                <p>The quality of Scale explores the relationship between the notion of public/intimacy and monument/object especially referring to the quality of sculpture and its relationship with exhibition space, viewer and light.</p>
                <p>“The quality of intimacy is attached to an object in a fairly direct proportion as its size diminished in relation to oneself. The quality of publicness is attached in proportion as the size increases in relation to oneself” 
( Robert Morris , Continuous Project Altered Daily, The Writings of Robet Morris, in Note on Sculpture Part 2, p13, October Book, the MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1995)</p>
                <p>Robert Morris defines part of these concepts on his reflections about sculpture analyzing the space between subject and object.
A smaller object needs less visual space space around itself determining a more intimate relationship with the viewer rather than a larger one that in order to be entirely seen in its whole necessarily requires the one to keep some distance. That establishes another kind of relationship between the viewer and the exhibition space . In this sense space does not exist for intimate object and in these terms it is possible to define the difference between Monument an and Object.</br>
Moreover , in the simpler polyhedrons such as cubes and pyramids , it is not visually needed to move around their structure to understand the configuration. They give to the viewer an immediate sense of their shape due to their simplicity. This immediate sense of awareness in their spatial extension involves perceptual theories of “constancy of shape”, “tendencies towards simplicity”, memory traces and physiological factors regards the nature of binocular parallax vision and the structure of retina and brain.
The site-specific intervention, thought specifically for the gallery space, arises from the confrontation with these considerations as a result of the realization of sculptural structures combined within the exhibition space and the fruition of light and image.</p>
